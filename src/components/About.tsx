          Hello, I’m Milan Soni, an aspiring Full Stack Developer and Software Engineer, pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Global Institute of Technology, Jaipur.

          I specialize in building dynamic MERN stack applications and have hands-on experience with Next.js, React, and backend technologies. My passion lies in creating user-friendly and efficient solutions, leveraging my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

          Some of my notable projects include MiningNiti and Logikendra, focusing on document and logistics management using LangChain, FAISS, and Python. Winning the Smart India Hackathon 2024 further strengthened my problem-solving abilities.

          Currently, I’m exploring modern web technologies like Three.js and AI/ML to enhance my skills and deliver impactful projects. I also take pride in organizing my college’s tech fest, HACKATHON CODEFIESTA, and aim to uplift my family through a meaningful career.
